# README

A visitor can become a member of this organization, or suggest any imporovement,
or point out any errors, by a push request to [this repository](https://github.com/theoretical-physics/start-here).

## Why Membership?

**Permission to write in (or push to) every repository within the organization
[theoretical-physics](https://github.com/theoretical-physics) is granted to every member of this organization.**

As a corollary, everything released in these repositories is not guarranteed to be true.  It is the responsibility of
the reader to check whether the statements are true.  However,
- if a member releases false information **intentionally again and again**, he/she will be kicked off.

In addition,
- although you have the permission to write anything to anywhere, please do it gracefully.  And do not
make things into a mess.  Do not be offensive or annoying.
- Except for specifically permitted files/repositories, the working language is English.  Occasionally
small pieces of non-English remarks (e.g., the original name of a person or a place) are acceptable.

A member behaves not in this manner will be warned.  **If warned again and again, he/she will be kicked off.**
